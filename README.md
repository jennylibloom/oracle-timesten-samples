| [quickstart](./quickstart)  | Classic QuickStart and Scaleout samples. |
| [languages](./languages) | Open Source language support samples (Python and Node.js) | 
| [containers](./containers) | Sample showing how to run TimesTen in a container with a persistent database. |
| [kubernetes](./kubernetes) | Shows how to use the TimesTen Kubernetes Operator to deploy TimesTen in Kubernetes. |

## Supported TimesTen Releases
In general these samples require a _minimum_ of **TimesTen 22.1.1.1.0** but our recommendation is to always use the most recent release available for your platform. Some specific samples may require a more recent timesTen release; any such requirement will be detailed in the sample's README file. These samples all work equally well with regular Timesten or the free TimesTen Express Edition (TimesTen XE).
